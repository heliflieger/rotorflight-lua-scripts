# Dashboard widget

The *RFSuite* widget renders a theme from live telemetry and switches between a preflight,
an inflight and a postflight layout as the flight progresses. What the README says about it
is the starting point; these files carry the detail.

| File | What it will say | Start from | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `user-themes.md` | Copying a shipped theme into `/SCRIPTS/TOOLS/rfsuite.user/dashboard/`, editing it, and why a copy keeps its own settings. | nowhere yet | to write |
